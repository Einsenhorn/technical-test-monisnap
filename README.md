## What is this repository?

This repository is my work in progress for a technical test for [Monisnap](https://www.monisnap.com/fr/), I may have spend around 8 hours on it.

### Description
Based on a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/7f9BwAJVoGmsDfuebmaoUE/Case-Front-Monisnap) and an [API](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Monisnap/test-front-back), the goal of this test is to create the UI shown in the Figma.

There are some constraints such as:
- Mobile first but needs to be responsive on browser
- No restriction for the javascript framework you want to use
- [Icons](https://material.io/resources/icons).
- Fonts can be found in the Figma file
- You need to have a solution to host your solution.
- You have 24 hours to complete it

You will be evaluated on these criteria:
- Which technologies you used
- Code quality
- Stage management
- Front-end strategy / Architecture
- Testability (did you write tests? Are your components easily testable?)
